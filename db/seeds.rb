# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)



# user = User.create!(name: "Ken")
# food =Food.create!(name: "mash pizza", measurement_unit: 5, price: 5, user: user)
# recipe = Recipe.create!(name: "Pizza", preparation_time: 20.10, cooking_time: 2, description: "here is des", public: true, user: user)
# recipe_food1 = RecipeFood.create!(quantity: 5.0, recipe: recipe, food:food)
